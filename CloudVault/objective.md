# Project Objective: CloudVault - Secure Storage as a Service

## **Overview**
CloudVault is a secure, scalable, and efficient cloud storage service that provides APIs for storing, retrieving, and managing sensitive data. 
The focus is on implementing cloud-native principles with advanced security, high performance, and extensibility.

## **Project Goals**
- Build a secure and scalable storage service that mimics real-world cloud offerings (like AWS S3).
- Learn and apply advanced Java concepts, including Reflection API, Dynamic Proxies, and multithreading.
- Implement robust security features, such as JWT authentication, data encryption, and role-based access control.
- Optimize performance using JMH benchmarking, caching, and efficient data handling.
- Deploy a production-ready service with Docker, Kubernetes, and monitoring tools.

## **Key Features**

### **Core Features**
1. **Secure File Storage**:
   - Store files with strong encryption (AES-256).
   - Include metadata support for files (e.g., tags, access policies).

2. **Versioning**:
   - Keep multiple versions of the same file to allow rollbacks.

3. **Access Policies**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for file operations (Admin, User, Public).
   - Generate token-based temporary access URLs for sharing.

4. **Audit Logs**:
   - Log all file operations (uploads, downloads, deletions) for auditing.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize bulk uploads/downloads.
   - Use caching for frequently accessed files.

### **Advanced Security Features**
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt files at rest using AES-256.
   - Secure file transfers with TLS.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement JWT for API access.
   - Enforce fine-grained RBAC for secure file operations.

3. **Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection**:
   - Protect against abuse with IP-based rate limiting.

4. **Audit and Compliance**:
   - Maintain immutable logs for auditing and compliance.

### **Scalability and Deployment**
1. **Cloud-Native Architecture**:
   - Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for scaling.

2. **Database Optimization**:
   - Efficient metadata storage with partitioning and indexing.
   - Optimize frequently executed queries.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Monitor API usage with Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Set up alerts for anomalies or unusual activity.

### **Additional Features**
1. **Signed URLs**:
   - Provide temporary, pre-signed URLs for secure file access.
2. **File Search**:
   - Enable searching files based on metadata or content.
3. **Custom Annotations**:
   - Use Javaâ€™s Reflection API for custom validations and metadata checks.

## **Learning Outcomes**
- Understand and apply advanced Java techniques in a real-world context.
- Build secure, scalable, and performant services using modern tools and frameworks.
- Gain experience with cloud-native technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud storage APIs.
